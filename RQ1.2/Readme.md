# Unsupervised Keyphrase Extraction

This folder consists of codes for supervised keyphrase extraction involving KPMINER [1] and YAKE [2] algorithms.

## Folder Organization

* **Code** - Consists of ipynb notebooks for each of the algorithms.
* **Data** - Consists of model files, preprocessed datasets suitable for KPMINER and YAKE. For more details on processing please see https://boudinfl.github.io/pke/build/html/tutorials/training.html. Please note that some of these algorithms depends on results of KEA. So train KEA models accordingly.
