# Supervised Keyphrase Classification

This folder consists of codes for Generic Keyphrase-Rubric Relationship Classification involving language models [1]-[4]

## Folder Organization

* **Code** - Consists of a single ipython notebook that can run all the language model algorithms. Please note that extraction language model features requires GPU. So for extraction of feature please see [here](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/auto.html#automodelforsequenceclassification)
* **Data** - The data consists of 7 folders with features already extracted from transformers. Please note this extraction process requires well supported GPU or atleast colaboratory.
