# Unsupervised Keyphrase Extraction

This folder consists of codes for unsupervised keyphrase extraction involving graph based ranking algorithms [1]-[5]

## Folder Organization

* **Code** - Consists of ipynb notebooks all the ranking algorithms. Additionally, the code to identify candidate hyperparamter K is also provided [here](https://github.com/manikandan-ravikiran/cs6460-proj/blob/master/RQ1.3/code/Ranking_Approach_k.ipynb).
* **Data** - Consists of model files, preprocessed datasets suitable for Ranking Approaches. For more details on processing please see https://boudinfl.github.io/pke/build/html/unsupervised.html#graph-based-models
