## Introduction
This repository includes codes related to https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01549 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07019 focusing on Keyphrase Extraction, Keyphrase Classification & Keyphrase-Rubric Relationship Extraction from Complex Assignments. We analysize and study multiple supervised and unsupervised approaches for all the three tasks.
